Zayo Analysis by by Andrew Linenfelser, Zach Lamb, Ming Liew

# Of the Tranzact accounts without services: Which accounts should Zayo prioritize and why?
- [We think the top five are the Federal Government, Transportation,Regional Carrier/ISP, Retail, and Telecommmunications](http://linenfelser.github.io/book3/week13/team/zayoII.html)
# If Zayo sent quotes to all Tranzact accounts, how would you prioritize the customer account list?
# If Zayo only had 5 representatives, which states would you prioritize for inÂ­person meetings?
# If Zayo only had enough team members to focus on two products, which products would you prioritize?
- [We would prioritize Elan and Standard Wavelength](http://zachlamb.github.io/book3/week13/team/zayo2.html)
# Of the Tranzact accounts that have services: What industries/verticals spend the most money and on what products/services?
